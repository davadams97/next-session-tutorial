## Next session tutorial

This is a simple Next.js project that demonstrate the usage of sessions. It is used as teaching material 
on how authentication works on backend frameworks. 

Note: Due to the scope of this project, I intend to not depend on third party packages that serve as abstractions
around how sessions are created and used when an authenticated user tries to access protected resources. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
